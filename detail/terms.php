              <p align="left"><strong>1.  BOOKING AND DEPOSITS</strong><br>
                Our Telephone bookings fill fast and are held for 14  days.  Your booking is confirmed when we  receive your Booking Form and your deposit of $100. Deposits can be paid via B  Pay, cheque or cash to our office direct. Deposits for tours are <strong><u>non-refundable</u></strong> but <u>may be</u> transferable to another date if 2 weeks notice is given.  <br>
                <strong><u>We Make It Easy For You!</u></strong><strong>  </strong>When you have made your Booking  and paid your deposit, then telephone for an appointment.  Get to know us, we like to hear about your  Group and discuss your tour day in person or ½ telephone appointment can be  made.</p>
            </div>

              <p align="left"><strong>2. COACHES</strong><br>
                Coaches are booked for specific times and  your Tour <strong><u>must leave promptly</u></strong> on time! <u>We are sorry but cannot wait for late arrivals – your tour is  precision timed</u>!  It is also <strong><u>not</u></strong> encouraged to be late home  from your Tour and we would appreciate your Group taking direction as to  timings on the day.  We don’t encourage 2nd  pick ups – they take away from your shopping time but can be done if really necessary!</p>
              <p>The Coach companies we use have strict  standards -- ‘<strong><u>No Smoking and No  Alcohol</u></strong>’ whilst on the Coach.</p>
              <p><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> Should your Group book 2  Coaches for your Tour – each Coach will be treated as a <strong><u>separate</u></strong>  <u>Booking.</u>  Each coach must have a Hostess and Driver, so  the price applicable to each coach is as per the Elite Brochure.  Example : if you have 68 passengers the cost  will be calculated for two (2) coaches of 34 at the 26 – 35, 36 – 44  category – not 68 passengers at the 45 -  56 category.   In the case of an overflow of extra passengers – you may be given 1  large Coach and 1 Mini Coach and Trailer and prices will be accordingly.<br>
                If you have over 55 guests  it may be that you will require a further Coach - these are options we are  happy to discuss with you.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>3.  FARES</strong><br>
                Please be aware that prices,  in our Elite package, are based on <u>actual numb</u>er of <strong><u>FULL ADULT  paying passengers on the day of your Elite Tour</u> – <u>completing</u> the  tour from the first outlet and <u>staying all day</u>.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>CHILDREN-</strong> <u>do not count</u> when assessing your category for payment.  Although we <u>do not</u> encourage children  (as it’s a long day) – we appreciate that as an example -  breastfeeding may carry into the factor of a  shopper mother being able to go on the day   We leave this to your Tour Organiser and group to liaise with the  passenger. Passengers <strong><u>12 years and under</u> – will be charged at full price </strong>and also if Hotel/Restaurant  luncheon is required, then the day will be charged at <strong>full price</strong></p>
              <p><strong>INDIVIDUAL PASSENGERS (“Hop Ons”) - Refer to Elite  Office for a price.</strong><br>
                In the past we have found some Organisers pay the rate of a  higher category with full knowledge they haven’t actually that number of  passengers.  If on the Tour day your  group has insufficient passengers to qualify for the fares nominated, your  group will fall into the next price bracket &amp; you are eligible to pay for  the price bracket applicable on that day.   For example: Paying for the 36 - 44 category knowing you only have 35  passengers is not permitted.<br>
              The difference will be deducted from your Gratuity Statement  if fundraising. If not fundraising the additional monies are due on the morning  of your tour.   Should your number rise and we are not made  aware (2 weeks in advance) then you are charged at the same price originally  quoted.  However, we make available for  you the option of latecomers joining in on the day and paying cash.  We suggest you aim as close as possible to  your numbers for the day.  We advise you,  as the Organiser, to charge your group the higher price bracket regarding  numbers you anticipate coming on tour to cover any last minute cancellations</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>******NOTE:  FULL PAYMENT OF YOUR FARE IS DUE AND PAYABLE AT OUR OFFICE <u>2 WEEKS</u> PRIOR  TO YOUR TOUR.  PAYMENT CAN BE MADE BY  CHEQUE OR MONEY ORDER OR BPAY.</strong><br>
                <strong>CASH MAY  BE BROUGHT INTO THE OFFICE.******</strong></p>

              <p><strong>A TOUR IS NOT PERMITTED TO  GO AHEAD UNLESS FULL PAYMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVED</strong>.  Any monies owing <strong><u>MUST BE PAID FOR ON  THE DAY OF YOUR TOUR PRIOR TO DEPARTURE </u></strong>or it can be deducted from your  Gratuity (commission)  if doing a Fundraising  tour. (Please liase with office)<br>
                Payment <u>on the day</u> of the tour is only  acceptable in very special circumstances &amp; must be approved by the office  prior.</p>

                Should  there be a reason why your Tour cannot go ahead on the day requested and you  have paid your deposit, although we <u>do not issue refunds</u> we are happy to  transfer your deposit to another date in the same year.  During the months of October, November,  December, should a tour be cancelled, all monies will then be <u>non-refundable  and non-transferable</u> as we have allowed you that day and as it’s high  season we may have had to turn away another Booking.  (Cancellations <strong><u>must be notified in writing</u></strong> 2 weeks prior to tour).<strong></strong></p>

              <p>Please refer our website – <a href="http://www.eliteshoppingtours.com.au/">www.eliteshoppingtours.com.au</a> for our Map of Area – alternatively telephone Elite Office for a copy.</p>
              <p>Elite has been generous with  boundaries, however if you are outside these it is <u>imperative</u> that <u>an  extra charge</u><br>
                occurs – example + $1-$5  per passenger (for outside our Elite map boundary) – depending on where you are  wanting your Pick Up.  Please liaise with  Elite Office staff to check your area pricing.</p>
              <p>If you are providing your  own coach there <strong><u>must be 20 ADULT passengers</u>   <u>on board</u></strong> for the whole day,  otherwise there will be an additional cost even if you have paid for 20  passengers.</p>

                We enjoy the opportunity of you coming to visit us or  organising a telephone appointment for your tour day and outlets and have a  closer liaison with your group so you have the best day.  This is <u>your time</u> to state <strong><u>exactly</u></strong> what you would like on <strong><u>your</u></strong><u> </u>Itinerary and <strong><u>Invitation</u></strong>.  Elite office offers suggestions and advice.</p>
              <p>Your  Tours are usually booked 4 weeks prior to Tour date and cannot be changed.  While we endeavour to be flexible, it is not possible to make Itinerary and  Invitation changes once outlets have been booked. </p>

              <p align="left"><strong>6.  COMMISIONS – FOR FUNDRAISING</strong><br>
                As Elite Shopping Tours liaises with over 50+ outlets, shops,  warehouses etc. for you it may be that at times a percentage on some may be  lower than another tour company.  Elite  Shopping Tours percentages vary 5% or 10%.   <strong><u>No Commission will be paid to  a group when numbers drop below 18.</u></strong>   All Outlets and Commissions are itemised on your <strong><u>Gratuity  Statement</u></strong> posted with Fundraising cheque approx. 2-4 weeks after tour<strong></strong></p>

              <p align="left"><strong>7.  OUTLET GIFTS / RAFFLE PRIZES</strong><br>
                Raffle Prizes are donated by the majority of  outlets.  Elite Shopping Tours has no  control over the value or quality of the prizes given.<br>
                <strong><u>Outlets Visited</u></strong><br>
                It has been mentioned to us at times that  groups may feel they are travelling to and fro.   The reason for this can be any of the following:<br>
                *           Because of location<br>
                *           So all your outlets can fit into your  time frame<br>
                *           Because of time eg. some outlets open  later than others or close earlier than others<br>
                *           Outlets are booked out and will not  take any more bookings at certain times<br>
                On the odd occasion we may give you another outlet rather than your  first preference because of location and also as mentioned above.  On an  Elite Shopping Tour Invitation<strong> “A Choice Means” </strong>if you are in a  particular area, there may be one or several outlets in close proximity.  You can either choose one if <strong>time permits</strong> or do all outlets.…..</p>
